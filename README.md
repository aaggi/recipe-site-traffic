**From my Data Scientist Professional Certification on DataCamp**

The project resamples a real life Data Science assignment. The assignment is to perform an analysis and write a short report.
As well as prepare and deliver the presentation for the product team.
The product team wants to predict which recipes will be popular 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes.

In other words, the task is to:

    - Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic?
    - Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time?

**Written Report**

The written report (notebook) include written text summaries and graphics of the following:

● Data validation:

    ○ Describe validation and cleaning steps for every column in the data
    
● Exploratory Analysis to answer the customer questions ensuring you include:

    ○ Two different types of graphic showing single variables only
    
    ○ At least one graphic showing two or more variables
    
    ○ Description of your findings
    
● Model Development including:

    ○ What type of problem this is
    
    ○ Fitting a baseline model
    
    ○ Fitting a comparison model
    
● Model evaluation

    ○ Show how the two models compare
    
● Definition of a metric for the business to monitor

    ○ How should the business monitor what they want to achieve?
    
    ○ Estimate the initial value(s) for the metric based on the current data?
    
● Final summary including recommendations that the business should undertake
